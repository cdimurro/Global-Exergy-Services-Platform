This is methodologically simplified. Proper implementation would track historical efficiency gains and apply rebound only to the delta. However, this simplified approach provides a conservative estimate and avoids overestimating useful energy. Future versions should implement time-series tracking of efficiency improvements for more accurate rebound modeling."
